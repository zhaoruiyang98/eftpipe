* `ascii` folder contains power spectrum measurement of each realization
* `summary` folder contains:
  * noric: w/o systematics
  * ric: w/o systematics, w/ radial integral constraint (ric)
  * standard: w/ systematics, w/ ric
  * standard_noric: w/ systematics, ric was subtracted using: standard_noric = standard - (ric - noric)
  * DR16: DR16 data
  * DR16_noric: DR16 data, ric was subtracted using: DR16_noric = DR16 - (ric - noric)
* window functions
  * measured using DR16 random catalogue and noric random catalogue
  * curves below 20 Mpc/h are smoothed by Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter
  * originally measured in 100 s bins from 1 to 3500 Mpc/h, and then cubic interpolated in logs space
  * normalized to match power spectrum in each folder
* naming convention:
  * P: power spectrum
  * Q: chained power spectrum
  * E: ELG
  * L: LRG
  * X: LRG ELG cross correlation
  * cov_: covariance matrix
  * win_: window function
